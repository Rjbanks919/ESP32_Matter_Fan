    > Flashing an ESP32 in an Ubuntu VM is wonky, need to set:
        - Serial flash config --->
          [*] Disable download stub
        - Slows down flashing, but it works!

    > Pairing code by default is: [2020-2021]

    > Need to setup SSID/Password in 'idf.py menuconfig', attrs are:
        1. DEFAULT_WIFI_SSID
        2. DEFAULT_WIFI_PASSWORD

    > Once I had the above things setup, powering up the device was pretty
      simple!
